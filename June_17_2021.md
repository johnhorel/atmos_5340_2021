# Python Strings
## Chapter 3 from the Alex DeCaria textbook: 'Strings'

In programming, a string is traditionally a sequence of characters, either as a literal constant or as some kind of variable.
- Strings are normally enclosed using single, double, or triple quotation marks
- Quotes used the start and end of a string must match
- Strings are considered 'literals' in that they have no special meaning or numeric representation.
- Quotations within a string are valid, if the quotations used to enclose the string is different than the quotations *within* the string
    - "This string is going to work" and "This string isn't going to cause problems either" or 'Derek says "Hello"' are all valid
- Like numeric data types, string can also be manipulated within Python.
- Strings are very important to be able to document the data you are using and label figures


**Before starting:** Make sure that you open up a Jupyter notebook session using OnDemand so you can interactively follow along with today's lecture! If you have forgotten how to do this, refer to the previous lecture and class notes.

## Special Characters

Special characters are used in Python to denote formatting commands such as new lines (\n), returns (\r), and tabs (\t). These can be included within a string!

For example, lets say I want to print the Bias and root-mean-square error for a temperature error analysis from a weather forecast model. I can use the new line special character to print the results to a difference line!

    report = 'bias = 2.2 \nRMSE = 3.5'
    print(report)
    >> bias = 2.2
    >> RMSE = 3.5

this is technically more concise than just printing out the results using two lines of code. For example, we would of needed to do the following:

    bias = 'bias = 2.2'
    rmse = 'RMSE = 3.5'
    print(bias)
    print(rmse)
    >> bias = 2.2
    >> RMSE = 3.5

The example below shows a combination of a new line character (\n) and a tab (\t) within the same string:

    forecast = "Today's weather in Salt Lake City will see a high temperature of 94\n\t with partly cloudy skies"
    print(forecast)
    
    >> Today's weather in Salt Lake City will see a high temperature of 94
           with partly cloudy skies

Finally, there may also be situations where you will need to include special characters such as \n and \t as 'literals'. To treat these special characters as literals, just add a leading forward slash \ before the character. For example:

    print('Hello \\n there!')
    >> Hello \n there
    
    print(print('Hello \n there!')    #No leading slash example....
    >> Hello
         there

## Formatting strings    
 
Often times, a programmer may need to edit a string, such as inserting a new character, or converting a numerical data type to a string. Python has a number of handy functions that allows the programmer to easily do this!

Python's **'format'** statement allows variables to be inserted into a string, and allows the user to manipulate the width and number of decimal places that are displayed. For example:

    x = 90.8366284
    
    print("Today's predicted high temperature is: {0:6.0f} F".format(x))
    >> Today's predicted high temperature is:     91 F

Here, the format statement is used to add 5 leading spaces to our temperature, with 0 decimal places, *thus 90.blahblah is rounded to 91*. The curly brackets proceeding the format statement tells Python where x should be inserted in our string, and how that variable should be manipulated. 

There are six format specifiers that the user should be aware of:

| Specifier | Description | 
|--|--|
|d|indicates integer data|
|f|indicates floating-point data|
|e|indicates floating-point in scientific notation|
|g|indicates floating-point in scientific notation for exponents less than -4 and greater than 5|
|%|indicates floating-point converted to a percentage|
|s|indicates string data|

More examples on how the format statement can be used to manipulate strings can reviewed in Chapter 3 Section 3.3 of the DeCaria text.

## String indexing

Similar to lists and tuples, items within a single string (i.e characters) are assigned a unique index. This would be analogous to elements within a list. 

    cloud = 'cumulonimbus'
    print(cloud[0])
    >> c
    
    print(cloud[1])
    >> u
    
    print(cloud[0:5])
    >> cumul
    
    print(cloud[-1])
    >> s
    
    print(cloud[5:])
    >> onimbus
 
<br><br>
---
---

## String concatenation and multiplication

In addition to making insertions within strings, strings can also be manipulated by concatenation. This can simply be done by adding a plus sign (+) between two strings. For example:

    print('hot'+'dog')
    >> hotdog
    
this can also be done multiple times as seen below:

    print('root-'+'mean-'+'square '+'error')
    >> root-mean-square error
    

Strings within a list can also be merged together using the join function:

    weather = ['I','LOVE','THE','WEATHER!']
    print(' '.join(weather))
    >> I LOVE THE WEATHER!

Strings can also be multipled...

    print('best '*5)
    >> best best best best best 


<br><br>
---
---

## Searching for a string 

Python also contains tools that are useful for searching for specific characters and strings. The `find` and `index` methods are often employed for this type of task. 
- `string.find(target,[i,j])` will return an integer that repesents the value of an index that correponds to the first instance of the target within string.

An example of the find method in action:

    my_string = 'orange'
    print(my_string.find('a'))
    >> 2
  
`string.index(target,[i,j])` works similarly to find, except it will return an error if a matching value is not found. Both find and index work from left to right. To search from the back of the string (right to left) use `rfind()` or `rindex()`.

<br><br>
---
---
    
## Other useful methods for manipulating strings....

**Replacing text:** `string.replace(target,new)` replaces all occurances of the *target* with the new text *new*. The original string `string` is not changed, and instead, a copy is created. 

**Stripping text:** `string.strip()` removed leading white spaces, tabs, new line characters, ect... `string.rstrip()` works similarly, but in the reverse direction. 

**Splitting text:** `string.split()` method can be used to split a string `string` on a specific delimiter. This will return a list. For example:

    my_animals = 'cat, dog, mouse, bird'
    print(my_animals.split(','))
    >> ['cat', ' dog', ' mouse', ' bird']

or

    print(my_animals.split(' '))
    >> ['cat,', 'dog,', 'mouse,', 'bird']
    
**Inserting:** Since Python strings are *immutable*, it is not possible to insert a character within a existing string. However, we can make use of the string subset command and the join command `+` to create a new string with our desired change. 

For example, lets say we wanted to add a space between the words Environmental and Programming in the string below:

    my_string = 'EnvironmentalProgramming'
    new_string = my_string[:13]+' '+my_string[:13]
    print(new_string)
    >> 'Environmental Programming'

#  Python Mathematical Operators and Functions
## Chapter 4 from the Alex DeCaria textbook: 'Mathematical Operators and Functions'

Operators are the commands that manipulate the values of variables, especially for numeric data types.
- Can be used to change the value of an object using basic math operators ( + - x / )
- There are also operators, which can truncate, compare, and round.
- More sophisticated math functions can performed using the numpy module (trigonometry, exponentials/logarithms, inverse trig. and hyperbolic, and other numeric functions.

# Operators
You can use Python much like a calculator. Type the following statements and press `enter` to run the line of code:   
<!---->
    1+2
<!---->
    1/2
<!---->
    2**2
<!---->  
    5%2
> ## Do it yourself
> Try different numbers and find out what each of the operators do.
>- What does the `+` operator do?   
>- What does the `-` operator do?   
>- What does the `*` operator do?   
>- What does the `/` operator do?   
>- What does `//` operator do?  
>- What does the `**` operator do?  
>- What does the `%` "modulo" operator do?

# Variable Assignment
In math/physics, variables are often part of equations/formulas. In computing languages, variables are much more flexible and can be assigned a value, then reused with a different value, etc.

Variables are names that values are assigned to with the `=` operator. In programing, `=` means "assigned to" _not_ "equals".

A variable is a value of some quantity, but to describe it requires:
- a name
- a storage location

Normally, the variable name references the stored value. Keeping the name and content separately allows the name to be used independently of the information it represents.

When a program executes, the name is bound by the computer source code to a value but the value of the variable may change during program execution.

<br><br>
---
---

|Rules for Variable Names| Example|
|--|--|
|Can be a combos of letters and numbers.|`alpha3`, `Timer8`
|Names are case sensitive.|`Pressure` is different from `pressure` and `PRESSURE`
|Must start with a letter.| Good: `var1 = 5` <br> Bad: `1var = 5`
|Can use underscores.| `potential_temperature`|
|Should be descriptive.| `temp` or `temperature` is better than `t`.|
|By convention, use all CAPS for constants:| `TEMP_0C_IN_K = 273.15`

> Note: There are 32 keyword names that are reserved becuase they have special meaning in Python. Variable names cannot be words like `del`, `and`, `if`, `global`, `for`, etc. 
>
>[Reference: Python Keywords](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/keyword-list)


We can assign values to a variable and use the variables in expressions.

    # Calculate the hypotenuse of a triangle
    a = 3
    b = 4
    c = (a**2 + b**2)**(1/2)
    print(c)

 >Note: The `#` symbol indicates the line is a comment and not code. Everything in the line after the symbol is disregarded when the line of code is run.

## Do it Yourself
Try assigning a few variables and add the variables together.

    # Convert degrees Celsius to degrees Fahrenheit
    temp_c = 10
    temp_f = temp_c * 9/5 + 32

## Boolean Types

**Recall that booleans are either `True`  or `False`**. 
  
- True is equivalent to 1 or 1.0
- False is equivalent to 0 or 0.0

Try: 

    bool(0)
    bool(3)
    bool(1-1)
    type(bool(1-1))

Booleans are often used with "comparison operators".

### Comparison operators
- Return boolean values of True or False
- You can compare integer, floats, and strings

|Description|Operator|
|--|--|
|Equal to| == |
| Not equal to | != |
| Less than | < |
| Greater than | > |
| Greater than or equal to | >= |
| Less than or equal to | <= |

Try:

    5 > 9           # Great than
    10 == 3         # Equal to
    12 <= 100       # Less than or equal to
    12 != 3.4       # Not equal to
    
    b = 3 > 8
    print(b)
    type(b)

### 🏈 Did Utah beat BYU last Thursday?

    # Utah and BYU scores by quarter
    Utah_q1 = 3
    Utah_q2 = 6
    Utah_q3 = 7
    Utah_q4 = 14

    BYU_q1 = 0
    BYU_q2 = 6
    BYU_q3 = 0
    BYU_q4 = 6

    Utah_final = Utah_q1 + Utah_q2 + Utah_q3 + Utah_q4
    BYU_final = BYU_q1 + BYU_q2 + BYU_q3 + BYU_q4

    print('Did Utah beat BYU last Thursday?')
    print(Utah_final>BYU_final)
    print('Final Score: Utah', Utah_final, '--','BYU', BYU_final)

## Numpy

In addition to doing basic math and comparison operators, Python has the ability to perform slightly more complicated tasks using the *Numpy module*. Numpy stands for the Numerical Python module, which expands upons the basic functions are features that comes with the base version of Python. Most distributions of Python already include this module, so often times you do not need to install this on your own!

To activate the Numpy module, do the following command:

     import numpy as np 
     
This command simply tells Python to load the *Numpy module* and denote this package as *np*, where is a shorthand version of Numpy. Whenever you use a function from Numpy, you will need to follow the function with a `numpy.<function>`. With the above shortcut, we can call a numpy function with `np.<function>`, which is shorter, and more elegant looking. 

Through Numpy, we can do things like Trignometry or work with exponentials or logarithmic numbers. Numpy also comes with some useful tools for rounding numbers, computing the absolute value, or doing something as simple as taking a mean. 

Listed below are some examples of useful Numpy functions:

    import numpy as np
    
    print(np.pi)                    #Returns constant for pi
    >> 3.141592653589793
    
    print(np.e)
    >> 2.718281828459045            #Returns constant for e
    
    print(np.log(10))               #Returns the natural log of x or 10 in this case. Equivalent to ln(x)
    >> 4.605170185988092
    
    print(np.log10(10))             #Returns the base 10 logarithm of x
    >> 1.0
    
    print(np.ceil(10.76342))        #Returns the nearest, highest integer
    >> 11.0
    
    print(np.floor(10.76342))       #Returns the nearest, lower-most integer
    >> 10.0
    
    print(np.abs(-22.61))           #Returns the absolite value of -22.61
    >> 22.61
    
    #Computes the average of a Python list, tuple, or array
    class_grades = [92,86,78,84,81,70,96,88,80,79,74,88,95]
    avg_grades = np.mean(class_grades)
    print(avg_grades)
    
    >> 83.92307692307692
    
    #Computes the median
    med_grades = np.median(class_grades)
    print(med_grades)
    >> 85.0
    
    print(np.round(avg_grades,2))    #Rounds our number to the decimal place specified in the argument on the right (2)
    >> 83.92
    
    print(np.max(class_grades))      #Computes max value in our list
    >> 96.0
    
You get the idea.... Refer to the DeCaria text for **Chapter 4** for a list of many more useful Numpy functions!
    

Finally, these are also functions to find NaN values, which are commonly used in the sciences to flag erroneous data or missing data.

For example....

    temp_slc = [76,77,77,80,82,85,90,94,96,97,98,99,99,97,93,88,87,np.nan]  
    print(temp_slc)
    >> [76, 77, 77, 80, 82, 85, 90, 94, 96, 97, 98, 99, 99, 97, 93, 88, 87, nan]
    
    print(np.isnan(temp_slc))
    >> array([False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False,  True])
