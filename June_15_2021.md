<br><br>

## Reviewing the Stats Content in Your Own Directory
1. It is really important to program in your own directory and not in someone else's directory
1. Log in to https://ondemand-class.chpc.utah.edu/
1. As before, under the Clusters top tab, select the Notchpeak Shell Access
1. Provide your password to then obtain a linux terminal window
1. type 'pwd'. You are in your home directory, correct?
1. type 'cd atmos_5340' . Check that you are now in your class subdirectoy, correct? 
1. type 'ls -l' . What do you see?
1. type 'cd chapter1' and then another 'ls -l'. What is in there? Look specifically at the suffixes- what follows the period in the file name.
1. type 'cd ../data' and then another 'ls -l'. What is in there? Again, look at the suffixes
1. type 'more alta_snow.csv'. CSV files are a common way to exchange information. 
1. We're going to access all of these files most frequently using the Jupyter notebook framework as detailed below.

> ## From _The Zen of Python_, by Tim Peters  
>Beautiful is better than ugly.  
Explicit is better than implicit.  
Simple is better than complex.  
Complex is better than complicated.   
Readability counts.

>>To read the full _Zen of Python_, type `import this` in a Python terminal.

Python is a popular general-purpose computer programming language invented by the Dutch programmer Guido van Rossum in 1990.

Python has grown into one of the top 3 most-popular programming languages, ranked by usage: https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/.

![](./images/languages_2021.PNG) 

It is heavily used by many companies including Google, Dropbox, Netflix, Spotify, Facebook, Goldman Sachs, etc. and, of course, in environmental science. 
<br>

## Stepping back for a second, why programming?
Learning a new language is difficult! You may find Microsoft Excel is fine for your MSSST research
- But environmental data sets uare often very large
- A simple CSV file with weather station data can easily have millions of lines
- Numerical weather prediction data and other environmental data sets are often provided in compressed file formats not readable by Excel
- Its difficult to automate processes with Excel and other spreadsheet applications!
- Ultimately, programming is quicker, *and easier* once you have become proficient using codes from scratch but more likely ones that have been developed by others for similar applications

<br>

## Why use Python?
- Python software is **open source**, meaning that people can freely modify and share it.
- Python **syntax**, or the programing language's "grammar rules", is relatively intuitive compared to other languages. 
- Python Code can be easier to read due to formatting conventions. 
    - e.g., indented code blocks.
- Code is **interpreted** rather than **compiled**.  
    - Interpreted code runs slower, but is easier to write and debug.
- Python is relatively easy to learn. There is abundant documentation and learning material available online.
- Python is equipped to deal with almost all problems. While it does not necessarily excel at one thing in particular, its good at doing 'everything'
- More environmental science is being done in Python.
 - Python is object-oriented. Everything is an object. This makes coding very flexible but can also be confusing. We'll tend to use Python in a procedural-programming context that should minimize the confusion.

<br>
# Python 3 is the version you should be using
Differences in coding in the heavily used Version 2.7 are relatively minor but can create issues.
- Python 3.7 is ready for you to use via OpneOnDemand via CHPC! 
- However, if you are feeling adventurous, you could install Python 3 on your own computer!
- For [Mac](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/)<br>
- For [PC](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/)<br>

<br>

A few more things about Python
- Python is dynamically typed
    - Variables generally do not need to be declared before using them (i.e real, string, integer)
- Python has a robust built-in set of data types, and users are free to define additional structures.
- Python is **case sensitive**.
    - Pressure, pressure, PRESSURE will be 3 completely different variables!
- Python is object oriented 
    - A programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data, in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures

## Jupyter Lab Environment
<br>
To log onto Jupyter Lab using CHPC's Open OnDemand, goto the following webpage: https://ondemand-class.chpc.utah.edu/
<br>
Under the Class tab on the topbar, select ATMOS5340
<br>
This website will require you to log in with your uID and password.
<br>
Select the options shown below. 
<br>
<img src='./images/atmos5340_launch.PNG' width=800px align='center' style='padding-left:100px'>
<br>
- Click the launch button below, which will submit your JupyterLab session to a queue. 
- It should take approximately 1-2 minutes for OnDemand to spin-up an interactive session. 
- Once it is ready, it should be similar to the image below. 
- A 'Connect to Jupyter' icon should appear. Click this!
<br>
Once this session is activated, you will be able to play around with Python! Remembering how to setup a Python Jupyter Lab session will be critical for the duration of this class, so make sure you understand how to access/create a new session!
<br>
- When you log in to Jupyter Lab, the default display should be the files in your home directory in the leftmost column. If not, then select the folder icon in the upper left
- Click on your atmos_5340 directory
- Click on your chapter_1 directory
- There should be three files in there. Click on each, What do you see?
<br>
- In the chapter1.ipynb window, select 'Run All' under the Cells top menu
- What happened? Did the Notebook run to completion?
- look at the files in the chapter_1 directory? Did you just recreate the two figures?
- Congratulations! You've just run your first Python program!
<br><br>

# Jupyter Notebooks
For the rest of the Python portion of the class, we will use _notebooks_ which allow for interactive exploration of Python programming.

A **notebook** is an interactive document containing code, output, graphics, and text (markdown). The standard suffix for a notebook is `.ipynb` short for "interactive Python notebook" (in case you were wondering). 

We will use the [Jupyter Lab](https://youtu.be/ctOM-Gza04Y) GUI environment to simplify viewing notebooks, writing and running Python code, and accessing other Python tools.

> If you look at a notebook file using a text editor, it will look odd with a lot of formatting structure. That is because a notebook is written as a [JSON](https://www.json.org/) file. JSON documents contain text, source code, rich media output, and metadata. Each segment of the document is stored in a cell. More to follow on JSON later. Don't sweat this detail now.

## How to view Notebooks

1. **GitHub**: _View only_  
You have already used the [class GitHub repository](https://github.com/johnhorel/ATMOS_5020_2018) to view class notes saved as markdown files. GitHub will also render Jupyter Notebooks, like this one.
2. **nbviewer**: _View only_  
Sometimes the GitHub rendition does not always work for one reason or another, even after refreshing. If this happens, copy the notebook's URL and open it in the [**nbviewer**](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).
3. **Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab**: _View, create, edit, and run_  
Jupyter Lab is the environment we will use to create, open, view, and edit Python notebooks.


# Explore Jupyter Lab
Familiarize yourself with the various menus in Jupyter Lab.

- Find the file explorer on the left menu.
    - How do you navigate folders and files?
    - What is a terminal?
    - What is a console?
    - What is a notebook?

## Create a new notebook
From the Launcher tab, create a new Python3 Notebook.

**Rename the notebook `my_first.ipynb`** 
- _How do you do that?_

Type some python statements in a "cell."

- `a = 5`
- `b = 10`
- `print(a+b)`

Run the commands in the cell by selecting the "play" button ▶ at the top or `shift+enter`.

> The `[*]` next to the cell indicates the cell is running. A number, `[1]`, indicates the cell was run and has finished. The number indicates the order the cells were run.

## How do you...
- edit a cell?
- insert a new cell?
- select a cell?
- run code in a cell?
- run all cells?
- change a cell from "code" to "markdown", and vice versa?

> What does 'restart the kernel' do?

> **Keyboard Shortcuts**: The keys `Shift+Enter` will run the selected cell.
>
> Reference: [Jupyter Shortcuts](https://github.com/johnhorel/ATMOS_5020_2018/blob/master/supplemental_docs/jupyter_shortcuts.md)  
> Reference: [Jupyter Notebook Documentation](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html)

## Other functions
- Right click a cell to see what you can do with it.
    - Cut, copy, paste, split, merge, delete etc.
- Hover mouse over top tool bar icons to see what they do.
    - The kernel is where Python runs. If the kernel gets stuck running bad code, you might need to stop/restart the kernel.
- Create a second notebook and put it side-by-side the other notebook
    - Click and drag the tab to move the window next to the other tab.

## Syntax and data types

**Before starting:** Make sure that you open up a Jupyter notebook session using OnDemand so you can interactively follow along with today's lecture! If you have forgotten how to do this, refer to the previous lecture and class notes.

**Reminder**: Recall, Python is case-sensitive! PRESSURE, pressure, and Pressure are *NOT* the same variables. Similarly, this also applies to functions as well. For example, the function print() will print out the value assigned to a variable, while Print() would result in an error, unless the user defined their own function named 'Print'.

    a = 1
    print(a)
   
    >>1
    
    
    Print(a)
    
    >>Traceback (most recent call last):
    >>File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    >>NameError: name 'Print' is not defined
    
<br><br> 

**Other notes about the print function:** This is a useful command to print out the values of variables to the command line. This is particularly useful when debugging code!
<br><br> 

**Function:** A function is a command that allows python (or any other programming) to peform an automated task, which internally consists of a number of Python commands (under the hood). For example, the function np.mean() will compute the mean of values assigned to the function. The assignment of values to a function is referred to as an 'argument'. Users can also define their own arguments if there is a particular, repeatable task that needs to be carried out. .

    import numpy as np
    values = [1,2,3,4,5]
    mean_val = np.mean(values)
    print(mean_val)
    
    >> 3.0
    
<br><br>     

**Code blocks and indentations:** While Python is considered a free-form language, and does have structure in that it uses indentations to delineate code blocks. This is useful in that it forces the user to properly indent their code, which generally makes a piece of code much more readable! Even in the absense of this requirement, all programmers should be indenting their code when appropriate as it makes it easier for a user to follow the logic of the code.

An example of this can be seen in the following for loop, which loops through each value between 0 and 5, and performs a command, and prints out a value depending on the index that we are on (0-5):

    for i in range(0,5):
        i = i **2
        print(i)
    
    >> 0
    >> 1
    >> 4
    >> 9
    >> 16
    
All loops in Python require a colon (:), which tells Python that it is about to execute a code block, like in the example above. Note, that while the indentation requirement is nice as it forces users to delineate their code appropriately, it can be difficult to copy-paste this code into the command line as tabs are sometimes not appropriately interpreted by the Python command line. With Jupyter notebook, this is not nearly as problematic. 
<br><br> 

**Continuation of lines:** Python does not have a line length limit like older programming languages like Fortran 77. However, it is recommended that longer lines are broken up to make the code more readable. To break up long lines of code, a '\' is used to signify that the following line is a continuation:

    x = 'My favorite type of cloud in the sky is a cumulonimbus' 
    >> x 
    >> 'My favorite type of cloud in the sky is a cumulonimbus'
 
 or 
 
    x = 'My favorite type of cloud' \
    'in the sky is a cumulonimbus' 
    >> x 
    >> 'My favorite type of cloud in the sky is a cumulonimbus'
    
There are also several scenerios where a \ is not necessary. For example, comma-seperated elements contained within a paranthesis (), bracket [], or curly brackets {} can be continued on a different line without using a \. For example:
    
    print('hello','my','name','is','derek')
    
    >> hello my name is derek
    

is the same as:

    print('hello','my','name',
    'is','derek')
    
    >> hello my name is derek
    
<br><br>  
**Comments:** Similar to most programming languages, a hash # is used to tell a code to skip a line. This is often used to make comments in the code that explain what a piece of code does.

<br><br> 

**Assigning variable names:** Letters and numbers can be used when naming a variable. Limitations include:
> Numbers can't be used as the first character when naming a variable<br>
> Leading underscores are not recommended<br>
<br>

Assigning a value to a variable can be accomplished using the assignement operator '='. For example:

    a = 3.14
    
Here a floating-point value of 3.14 has been assigned to a. Characters can also be assigned to variables:

    b = 'hello'
<br><br>  

**Numeric data types:** There are four numeric types used by Python. These include booleans, integers, floating-points, and complex numbers. Booleans are designated by 'True' or 'False':

    boo = True 
    boo = False
    
Integers is a variable that is an integer and is often used to index Python arrays. 

    a = 3
    
Floating-point values are different from integers in that they are stored as 64 bits or the equivalent of double percision. These variables can be expressed as decimals or using scientific notation:

    a = 4.1
    b = 4.6e9
    c = -7.3e3
    d = 6.5e-3
    
 It is worth noting that it is also possible to convert between numeric data types. For example you can convert a floating number into an integer:
 
     val = 4
     type(val)
     
     >> <class 'int'>
     
     val = float(val)
     print(val)
     >> 4.0
     type(val)
     
     >> <class 'float'>
     
Speaking of data types, the 'type' function can be used to determine the data type as seen above, and not just for numeric data types for that matter.

** Really Important** Train yourself to not think that '=' means equal- it doesn't. You are assigning a value from the right side to the left side.
<br><br>  

**Methods** can also be associated with variables. A method is analogous to function that belongs to a variable/object. We will see more examples of methods later in this course. 
<br><br>

**Strings:** Strings are assigned to a variable using single or double quotations. This will be more thoroughly discussed in the next following Chapter and class lecture. 

    my_string = 'hello'
    num_string = '456.3'
    
<br><br> 

**Lists and tuples:** These variable types are essentially collection of values. The major differences between lists and tuples is that lists are mutable, which means that their contents can be changed after being created. Tuples are immutable, thus cannot be changed after being created. These variables are assigned using square brackets or parentheses. 

    my_list = [4.5,-7.8,'pickle',5,1e7,True]     #List
    my_tupl = (4.5,-7.8,'pickle',5,1e7,True)     #Tuple
    
Lists and tuples can also be indexed to pull out individual elements or values within a list or tuple. 

    my_list[0]
    >> 4.5
    
     my_list[2]
     >> 'pickle'
     
     
     
<img src='./images/List-Slicing.jpg' width=600px align='center' style='padding-left:50px'>

Note that Python's indexing scheme is 0 based in that 0 represents the first element in a 1-D list/tuple/array.<br>
Some other tricks with Python indexing: -1 can be used to return the last element in a list/tuple/array.

    my_list[-1]
    >> True
    
In a somewhat longer way, you could also use Python's length function to grab the last element in a list/tuple/array. 

    my_list[len(my_list)-1]
    >> True
    
You can also subset a list/tuple/array by choosing an index range using a colon:

    my_list = [4.5,-7.8,'pickle',5,1e7,True]     #List
    my_list[1:3]                                 #Index range
    >> [-7.8, 'pickle']
    
    my_list[0:-1:2]                              #'Striding' example
    >> [4.5, 'pickle', 10000000.0]

Indexing can also be used to reassign a value within a list:

    my_list[2] = 14
    print(my_list)
    >> [4.5, -7.8, 14, 5, 10000000.0, True]
    
Finally, if you accidently assign an index that is outside of indices within a array, Python will spit back the following error:

    my_list[10]
    >> Traceback (most recent call last):
    >> File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    >> IndexError: list index out of range


<br><br>
Instead of manually defining a range of numbers, the 'range' function in Python can be used to create a sequence of integers. The arguements for the range function include the starting value, ending value, and the stride: range(start,end,stride)

    my_list = list(range(0,10,2))
    print(my_list)
    >> [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
    
If no stride is included, the range function defaults to using a stride of 1.

     my_list = list(range(0,10))
     print(my_list)
     >> [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
     
 **Some useful functions when working with lists...***
 
     > len(my_list)                      #computes length of a list
     > del my_list[i:j]                  #deletes values at the i through j index
     > my_list.append(element)           #adds an element to the end of an existing list
     > my_list.extend(another_list).     #adds values from another list to an existing list
     > my_list.count(target)             #counts instances of target variable in our list
     > my_list.reverse                   #reverse our list
     

<br><br>

**Dictionaries:** A dictionary is similar to a list with the exception that instead of indexing with integers, a dictionary uses a key number, string, or another object. 

    thisdict = {"brand": "Ford","model": "Mustang","year": 1964}
    
One of the 'keys' in this case is model:

    thisdict["model"]
    >> 'Mustang'
 
 which will retrieve the cars 'model'.
 
Another example: 

> ### Note: The `\` symbol indicates the code continues on the next line.

    my_dictionary = {1:'b', \
                     2: [23,265,12,43], \
                     3: ('this', 'is', 'a', 'tuple')}

    print(my_dictionary.keys())
    print(my_dictionary[1])
<!---->
    another_dictionary = {'name':'Derek', \
                          'school': 'university of utah', \
                          'hours in office': [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]}
    print(another_dictionary.keys())
    print(another_dictionary['name'])
    print(another_dictionary['name'][0])
    # Notice how the key name can include spaces. This is just a string used to index the dictionary.
